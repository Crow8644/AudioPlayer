<h1>Audio Player Project</h1>
<p>This project is a standard media player for playback of audio files. It is a WPF application using .NET and which runs on Windows. The project currently supports playback of .wav, .mp3, .aiff, and .wma files with typical media player functionalities, including a volume slider, skip buttons, scrubbing, and displaying of embedded photos.</p>

<p>I am using this project to teach myself F#. It is not completely idiomatic F# code, as my main focus has been on working with the language's syntax, defaults, and capabilities.</p>

<p>This project makes use of two open-source libraries: <a href="https://github.com/naudio">NAudio</a> and <a href="https://github.com/Zeugma440/atldotnet">ATL</a>. These must be installed independantly in order to run this code.</p>
